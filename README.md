# Frontend Mentor - Article preview component Astro Migration

![Design preview for the Article preview component coding challenge](./public/design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## About this project ðŸ‘‹

This is me remaking/migrating the site I previously made using only pure HTML/CSS/JS, to using [Astro JS](https://astro.build/)

Im doing this with the aim of getting comfortable with creating websites using Astro.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this article preview component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
-   See the social media share links when they click the share icon
